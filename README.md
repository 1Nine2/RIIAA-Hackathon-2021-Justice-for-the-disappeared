# RIIAA-Hackathon-2021-Justice-for-the-disappeared
Between 1964 and 1985 (the Dirty War), the Mexican state confronted and repressed social movements, leaders of political-military organizations, sympathizers, families, and communities. It generated tons of institutional archives of this repression. The objective of this challenge is to detect the different types of objects (photos, text, signatures, etc.) that exist in these documents.
Different recognition algorithms, one for each feature
Use of Pytorch Facenet for face detection
Use of image processing with Open CV for signature identification
Use of Azure Cognitive Services for stamp detection
Use of Layout Parser for table recognition
Algorithm independence for use in different datasets
